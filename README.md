# Cross Road
A simple endless game in your terminal.

To run the game:
```sh
go mod tidy
go run main.go
```

Or you can download the executable from [here](https://github.com/ashkan-jafarzadeh/cross-road-game/releases/download/V1.0.0/cross-road-game), give it the needed permission (`chmod +x cross-road-game`) and run:
```sh
./cross-road-game
```

Hope you enjoy it :)
